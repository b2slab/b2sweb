Hi there. My name is Flavio Palmieri and I'm an Assistant Professor within the [Serra Hùnter program](https://recercaiuniversitats.gencat.cat/ca/serra-hunter/inici/) at the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (Polytechnic University of Catalonia, UPC), campus [Barcelona School of Engineering Est - EEBE](https://eebe.upc.edu/en?set_language=en).

## From Student to Scientist: A Journey in Biomedical Engineering 
I hold a B.Sc. (2015) and M.Sc. (2018) in Biomedical Engineering from the Università Politecnica delle Marche (Ancona, Italy). In June 2022, I completed an industrial Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering through a joint program between Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya and the University of Zaragoza, under the supervision of [Professor Pablo Laguna](https://i3a.unizar.es/es/investigadores/pablo-laguna-lasaosa) and [Professor Pedro Gomis](https://portaldeinvestigacionviu.com/es/main/profile/105). 

From June 2022 to December 2023, I was a postdoctoral researcher in bioinformatic at [Institut de Recerca Sant Joan de Déu (IRSJD)](https://www.irsjd.org/en/) in the [Metabolic diseases of pediatric origin gorup](https://www.irsjd.org/en/people/staff/197/jose-carlos-jimenez-chillaron), supported by a fellowship from the [John Templeton Foundation](https://www.templeton.org/).

In January 2024, I was awarded a “Juan de la Cierva” postdoctoral fellowship from the Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities. I held this position at the University of Barcelona, Department of Physiological Sciences, [Biophysics Unit](https://mmfpd-ub.wixsite.com/mmfpd) until I was appointed assistant professor at the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC)

Currently, I am a member of the [B2SLab](https://b2slab.upc.edu/), part of the Institut de Recerca i Innovació en Salut ([IRIS](https://iris.upc.edu/)), formerly known as the Research Center for Biomedical Engineering (CREB). 

## Research interests 
I'm passionate about using computational tools to better understand how our bodies work at the cellular and molecular level—especially in the context of metabolic diseases and childhood health. With a background in biomedical engineering, my work bridges biology, data science, and medicine.

Over the years, I've been particularly drawn to spatial transcriptomics and cell type analysis, which help us see how different cells behave and interact in tissues. I enjoy exploring big biological datasets to uncover patterns that might tell us something new about health, disease, or development.

Whether it's through bioinformatics, machine learning, or systems biology, my goal is to turn complex data into meaningful insights that could one day support better diagnosis, research, or treatment.

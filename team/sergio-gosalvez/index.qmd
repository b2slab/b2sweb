Welcome! I’m Sergio Gosálvez, just starting a PhD in Bioinformatics at [B2SLab](https://b2slab.upc.edu/) at the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC). I’m happiest where maths, engineering and people meet.

My working thesis title is: **“Foundation models in primary care: interpretable learning from longitudinal EHR data in cardiovascular and endocrine disease.”** I work on deep learning for EHRs, modelling chronic conditions and predicting clinically relevant outcomes with modern architectures aiming for results that are both accurate and interpretable.

Before the PhD, I earned an MEng in Biomedical Engineering from Imperial College London and a Master’s in Biomedical Engineering from UPC. I also co-founded [Paige Braille](https://paigebraille.com), building technology that lowers barriers to learning braille for blind and visually impaired people.

I’m product-minded by default: APIs, web apps, or whatever puts a useful tool in someone’s hands. If it’s user-centred, I’m in.

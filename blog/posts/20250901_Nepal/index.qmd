In **rural areas of Nepal**, for cultural and economic reasons, the main source of energy is **firewood** 🔥: families typically cook on an **open fire made on the ground with three stones**, without using a chimney. Ventilation, therefore, depends on doors and windows, which in cold weather may be shut or only slightly open️.  

This results in **high levels of indoor pollution** ⚠️ that severely affect the health of the inhabitants, mainly **women and children**. In fact, Nepal is one of the countries with the **highest levels of household air pollution**. The World Health Organization estimates that every year **toxic gases from kitchens cause the premature death of around 24,000 people**.  


#### Project Goal: Safe and Accessible Cooking  

The aim of the research project is to promote the use of an **Improved Chimney and Hood System (CHS)** 🏡, optimized to prevent indoor pollution in rural areas of Nepal, without interfering with people’s habits and customs and without requiring a large economic investment 💰.  By **measuring air quality before and after installation** and objectively assessing the **health benefits**—mainly for women and children—the project seeks to **encourage easier adoption** of this technology.  

The initiative is coordinated by the **Awasuka Programme** (a cooperative project), with the participation of researchers from the B2SLab and BIOCOM-SC research groups.


#### Implementation and Results  

From **2019 until mid-2023**, **760 CHS systems** have been installed in the municipalities of **Bhimphedi, Bakaiya, and Dhunebesi (Nepal)**. For five months, **indoor air quality was monitored** in 10 homes before and after installation. A network of sensors measured **particulates (PM), carbon dioxide, temperature, and humidity**.  

The CHS design is capable of **extracting 90% of indoor smoke**. Results show:  

- **Average daily time with high PM levels** decreased from **3.5 hours/day to 0.6 hours/day** ⏱️  
- **Maximum CO₂ concentration** dropped from **5,500 ppm to 2,000 ppm** 💨  

Additionally, **210 women** were surveyed, half living with an improved CHS and half with traditional stoves. Women in households without the improved CHS reported **significantly higher rates of fever, headaches, eye irritation, heart disease, and migraines**.  


####  Recognition and Social Impact  

In recognition of its social impact, the project was awarded the [UPC Prize for Social Commitment 2025](https://www.upc.edu/ca/sala-de-premsa/noticies/dos-projectes-cooperacio-nepal-i-brasil-i-projecte-habitatge-social-agramunt-premis-upc-compromis-social-2025) 🏅, granted by the **Social Council of the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya – BarcelonaTech (UPC)**.  

The award highlights the project’s **contribution to improving public health and living conditions** in vulnerable communities through **applied research and international cooperation** 🌏.
